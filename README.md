# School District Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to review testing scores across a district and perform an analysis on them across differnt criteria, including spending per student, school size and more. Due to concerns of academic dishonesty the testing scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School have been removed from this data set. These results will be compared to a prior analysis to further review if academic dishonesty at Thomas High School is likely and any impact this may have on the testing metrics. 

## Results
* Below you can see a side by side comparison of the overall school district analysis including and excluding the 9th graders from Thomas High School. There was no impact on the Average Reading Score. However, you can see slight drops in all other metrics, with the most noteable being a decline in the percentage of students passing math by 0.2% and a decline in the percentage of the overall students passing of 0.3%. Given that there is a more noteable change in math scores than reading scores, additional focus will be placed on math results in the upcoming parts of this analysis.

* As can be seen in the screen shots below, the exclusion of the 9th graders at Thomas High School did slighly lower the averages and percentage passing scores for Thomas High SChool. The Overall Passing Percentage at Thomas High School decreased by 0.3%. This is consistent with the result we saw in the overall school district analysis above. There is also slight declines across the percentage of students passing math and reading and the average math and reading scores. As no scores were altered for any other school, there is no impact to any other schools scores.
